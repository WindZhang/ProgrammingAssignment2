## This funtion is to cache the inverse of square matrix. Please note:
## We assume the matrix supplied is always invertible.
## This R code is used for the peer assignment of Rprog-013.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve 
## the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
